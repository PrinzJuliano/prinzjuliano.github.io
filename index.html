              <div id="discover">Gaming connected to Programming</div>
            </h1>
            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>I started kind of traditionally with programming. When I was younger,
              I got into HTML and made my way through the HTML of the 1990s which used
              to be really blocky and basically undynamic. Thus I looked up how to make
              Webpages more dynamic and there used to be two available methods: PHP and
              JavaScript. PHP seemed very unlikely to me, since you need to set up an
              apache server or respective services to use PHP. Even though JavaScript
              does not fully replace PHP, it was a start in making HTML more dynamic.
              After I played around with JavaScript, I realized that the barebones HTML
              Webpages are looking relatively ugly in my opinion. I googled what to do
              about it. The answer was easy: Learn CSS. Now you might realize that my
              programming past has exactly nothing to do with gaming, right? Well that
              started a little later as I learned C++ by accident. My brother bought
              a book about programming Games with C++. I read the book and I could make
              an asteroid destroyer game in the end but that was not quite how I thought
              games should be made… C++ is a complex language after all.
              <br>
              <br>By now it is the 17th May 2009. Some of you immediately know which game
              came out and gave the programmer millions in that night. You guessed it:
              Minecraft by Markus “Notch” Persson. I got obsessed with the game. That’s
              by the way the first time I heard of the programming language Java. People
              on the forums said it’s incredibly easy to learn and I had a special motivation:
              Risugami’s Modloader. A simple API, direct response, easy language. Sooner
              or later I lost the motivation as some other mods made mod creation way
              too complicated. The first mod used to be SDK’s ModloaderMP for Multiplayer
              support and the second mod was Forge for better simultaneous mod integration.
              But this was not the end of my story concerning Minecraft. Some programmers
              made a special system for even better multiplayer. The Bukkit guys created
              a new way of multiplayer Minecraft with tons of plugins. And again a simple
              API made programming easy. And again plugins like Permissions and Pex made
              it complicated as most server admins looked for plugins that supported
              those plugins. I lost my motivation. But I stayed with Java which is my
              primary programming language. I did what a lot of people did. Bye a book.
              In my case a Java 101 for all around programming skills. It taught me the
              basics, OOP, more advanced stuff, GUI building, and networking. And finally
              I looked into making games with Java. Some might say this is not the best
              language to create games, and they are right. Nevertheless, I made some
              great 2D games with just AWT and later even 3D games with LWJGL.
              <br>
              <br>Then I looked into other topics of IT. First some other programming languages
              like Ruby, Python, C#, C# and XNA for making games, Visual Basic, and even
              assembly. The phase I was into making games again, C# and XNA were my solution.
              Then I swapped the framework and made games with Unity3D. Still I sometimes
              create some models with Blender and animate them with Unity and play around.
              <br>
              <br>The last step in my journey was the creation of my own OS. Yes you heard
              it! My own OS with assembly bootloader and kernel, and an GDT, IRQ, some
              basic keyboard drivers, and finally a Shell plus a vfs.
              <br>
              <br>Minecraft should lead me into another topic: Computercraft. Computercraft
              had some basic features when it came out. And it runs on Lua. Lua is simple
              to learn and extremely powerful. (See Garrys Mod). Now I am busy with Java
              FX, Swift, HTML/PHP/Bootstrap, and Lua for OpenComputers.
              <br>
              <br>As a conclusion, I would say Minecraft made some decisions for me concerning
              programming and I would not change it for anything in the world. To all
              of you guys who are undecided what to learn: Start with HTML. Everyone
              should make websites with HTML!
